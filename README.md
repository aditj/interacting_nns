### Meeting Notes: 
1. Over epochs not samples
2. Actions characterize the current belief
3. Not similar to social learning because the update is not inherently Bayesian, but the agent is learning from the other agent (Kalman filters are bayesian by design)


#### TODO:
- [x]   Get results for half the observation to the single NN
- []  Multiple neural networks with the same prior
- [] What does the prior mean? 
- [] What if the prior is the neural network weight?
- [] Incorporate the idea of Kalman filter and the public prior being the same  across
- [] The prior of the mean is updated using the other guy
- [] Vae 
- [] MDN with Gaussian Process
